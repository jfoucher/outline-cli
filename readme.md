## Outline CLI Editor

A simple command line tool to create new [Outline](https://github.com/outline/outline) documents

I use it on my self-hosted version but it probably works on the [hosted version](https://getoutline.com) as well.

## Installation

```
npm install -g outline-cli-editor
```
You will need an api token

Then run `outline-cli-editor` and it will ask you a few questions to configure itself.
